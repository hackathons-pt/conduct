## Why have a Code of Conduct?

The hackathons.pt community includes people from many different backgrounds. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristics.

The Code of Conduct has three main goals:

1. **Set a baseline for respectful behavior**, so that people with different communication styles can interact productively.  
2. **Provide a conflict-resolution mechanism** for when issues arise.  
3. **Ensure the community is welcoming**, because diversity is essential for building a strong and healthy ecosystem.

A healthy community allows disagreement and debate. This Code of Conduct is not here to silence differing opinions, but to ensure discussions remain respectful and safe.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

The Code of Conduct applies to all official hackathons.pt online spaces, communication channels, and in-person events, including but not limited to:

- hackathons.pt community spaces  
- Official hackathons and meetups  
- Online discussion groups, platforms, and calls  
- Organizing committees, working groups, and associated projects  

Organizers and volunteers representing hackathons.pt are expected to uphold a higher standard of conduct, both online and in person.

Independent events inspired by hackathons.pt are encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct but must provide their own moderators or conduct team.

## Hacker Values

These are the values we expect in the hackathons.pt community:

- **Be friendly and welcoming.**
- **Be patient.** People have different communication styles, and not everyone speaks the same native language.
- **Be thoughtful.** Consider how your words may be interpreted. Sometimes saying nothing is best.
- **Be respectful.** Especially when opinions differ.
- **Be charitable.** Assume good intentions. Seek to understand before disagreeing.

Avoid destructive behavior:

- Derailing conversations  
- Unconstructive criticism  
- Snarky or inflammatory remarks  
- Discussing sensitive or offensive topics that may cause conflict  
- Microaggressions  

Misunderstandings are normal. De-escalate conflicts and give others the benefit of the doubt.
